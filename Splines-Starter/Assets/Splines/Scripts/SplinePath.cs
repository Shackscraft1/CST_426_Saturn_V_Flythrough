/*
 * SplinePath joins cubic Bezier segments end to end. 3n + 1 points make n
 * segments: each segment's last point is the next segment's first point.
 * u = segment index + local t, so u runs from 0 to SegmentCount.
 *
 * The distance table approximates arc length with short chords at equal steps in u.
 * It is built once, in Awake. SamplePoint keeps reading the Transforms, so moving
 * a point updates the curve before the table is rebuilt.
